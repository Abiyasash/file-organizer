# file-organizer

This is a file organizer made in C++. It uses the filesystem library that is included in C++, with versions C++17 and later. It sorts these files by file extension.

When you compile, make sure to compile it like this:

<code>g++ <b>-std=c++17</b> main.cpp -o main</code>

The addition of -std=c++17 is important because otherwise the filesystem library will not be recognized.
